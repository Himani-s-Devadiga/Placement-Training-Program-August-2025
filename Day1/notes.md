# Day 1 – Placement Training (August 2025)
## Python Basics
The data types used in python are - int,float,char,bool,complex,str
There are 33 reserved words in Python
## operators
There are 6 types of operators:
Arithematic ,Relational,Logical,Bitwise,Assignment,Special operators 
## Arithmetic operators
It involves addition,subtration ,multiplication and division
## Relational operators
<,>,=,<=,>=
# Logical operators
AND,OR,NOT
## Bitwise Operators
- *AND* → &
- *OR* → |
- *XOR* → ^
- *NOT (~)* → One’s complement
- ## Identity Operators
- is, not is
- ## Membership operators
- in ,not in
- ## Special Operators
- combination of Identity and membership operators
- 
  Example:  
  ```python
  a = -45
  b = 7
  print(~a)  # +1 the negative number → output: 44
  print(~b)  # +1 the positive number → output: -8

Bit Shifts

Left Shift: x << n → multiply by 2^n

Right Shift: x >> n → divide by 2^n (floor division)

Example:

10 << 2  # 40
10 >> 2  # 2

Problems were made to do on codeforces and gave us practice on 10 basic python programs
