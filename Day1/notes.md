# Day 1 – Placement Training (August 2025)

## Python Basics
The data types used in python are - int,float,char,bool,complex,str
There are 33 reserved words in Python
### 0perators
There are 7 types of operators:
Arithematic ,Relational,Logical,Bitwise,Assignment,Special operators 
### Arithmetic operators
It involves addition,subtration ,multiplication and division
### Relational operators
<,>,=,<=,>=
### Logical operators
AND,OR,NOT
### Bitwise Operators
- *AND* → &
- *OR* → |
- *XOR* → ^
- *NOT (~)* → One’s complement
- #### Bit Shifts
  Example:  
  a = -45
  b = 7
  print(~a)  # +1 the negative number → output: 44
  print(~b)  # +1 the positive number → output: -8
  Example:
   10 << 2  # 40
   10 >> 2  # 2
- ### Identity Operators
- is, not is
- ### Membership operators
- in ,not in
- ### Special Operators
- combination of Identity and membership operators
- ### Assignment Operators
- +=,==,*=,/=,**=,&=,^=

## EXTRA-NOTES:
- Formula for right shift = x/2**y
- Formula for left shift = x * 2**y
- Left Shift: x << n → multiply by 2^n
- Right Shift: x >> n → divide by 2^n (floor division)
- Problems were made to do on codeforces and gave us practice on 10 basic python programs
