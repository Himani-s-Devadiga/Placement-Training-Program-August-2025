# Day 1 – Placement Training (August 2025)

## Bitwise Operators
- *AND* → &
- *OR* → |
- *XOR* → ^
- *NOT (~)* → One’s complement  
  Example:  
  ```python
  a = -45
  b = 7
  print(~a)  # +1 the negative number → output: 44
  print(~b)  # +1 the positive number → output: -8

Bit Shifts

Left Shift: x << n → multiply by 2^n

Right Shift: x >> n → divide by 2^n (floor division)

Example:

10 << 2  # 40
10 >> 2  # 2

Special Operators

Identity Operators: is, is not

Membership Operators: in, not in

problems were made to do on codeforces and gave us practice on 1p basic python programs
